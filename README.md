# 📆 Task Management Board

## ✏️ Description

Our task board solution is designed with project team members who are seeking efficient project management. This program easily organizes multiple tasks, tracks progress, and ensures every project stays on target. Say goodbye to scattered to-do lists and hello to streamlined productivity.

Task Board Management Criteria:

    ✔️ Display tasks in columns for different progress states: To Do, In Progress, Done.
    ✔️ Utilize color-coded indicators for task deadlines: Yellow for nearing deadline, Red for overdue.
    ✔️ Enable task creation via modal dialog, capturing Title, Description, and Deadline date.
    ✔️ Ensure task properties persist by saving them in localStorage upon confirmation.
    ✔️ Implement drag-and-drop functionality for updating task progress states.
    ✔️ Provide a deletion feature to remove tasks permanently from the task board.
    ✔️ Guarantee persistence of saved tasks across page refreshes.
